This is Yifei Yuan's personal homepage. 

## A short introduction
I am a fourth year PhD student at [CUHK text mining group](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~textmine/), supervised by Prof.Lam Wai. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019, majoring in bioinformatics.

Currently, my research interest focuses on multimodal information retrieval and text mining problems, including social media based fashion analysis, multimodal dialogue systems, etc. I'm also interested in other aspects of NLP and IR in the multimodal domain. 

<b>Research Interests:</b>
* Multimodal Information Retrieval
* Conversational IR
* Natural Language Processing
* Machine Learning


<!-- <b>Research Highlights:</b>
* Development of [spectral transformation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026962) and its [application](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126816) in hydro-climatology
* An open-source tool for improved system modelling: [Wavelet System Prediction (WASP)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104907)
* Quantification of future changes in drought and [agricultural production](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2617-z) under global warming
* Development of [index-based drought insurance](https://doi.org/10.1108/AFR-02-2020-0020) for disaster risk transfer -->
