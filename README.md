## Bio
I am currently a postdoc fellow at [Coastal NLP group](https://coastalcph.github.io/) at University of Copenhagen, working with Prof. Anders SÃ¸ggard. I previously obtained my PhD degree at [CUHK text mining group](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~textmine/), supervised by Prof.Lam Wai. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019, majoring in bioinformatics.

Currently, my research interest focuses on multimodal information retrieval and text mining problems, including social media based fashion analysis, multimodal dialogue systems, etc. I'm also interested in other aspects of NLP and IR in the multimodal domain. 

## Research Interests:
* Multimodal Information Retrieval
* Social Media Mining
* Image-text based Multimodal NLP
* Natural Language Processing
* Machine Learning
